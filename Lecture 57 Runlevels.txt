How To Change Current/Default Runlevel in CentOS 8 / RHEL 8:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Change Current/Default Runlevel in CentOS 8
Since CentOS 7 / RHEL 7, system run levels are replaced with targets and are managed by systemd.
Systemd targets are represented by target units and their configuration files end with .target extension.

This systemd target unit file contains other systemd units through a chain of dependencies.
For example, the graphical.target which provides graphical console starts GNOME service (gdm.service) and activates the multi-user.target unit.

Available Targets / Runlevels
CentOS 8 / RHEL 8 comes with a number of predefined targets that are more or less similar to the standard set of runlevels found in CentOS 6 / RHEL 6.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Runlevel  Target Units  		Description
0 runlevel0.target/poweroff.target 	Power off the system. => Shut down and power off the system.
1 runlevel1.target/rescue.target 	Single User mode without GUI, without networking. => Set up a rescue shell.
2 runlevel2.target/multi-user.target 	multi-user mode without GUI, without networking.  => Set up a non-graphical multi-user system.
3 runlevel3.target/multi-user.target 	multi-user mode without GUI, but with networking. => Set up a non-graphical multi-user system.
4 runlevel4.target/multi-user.target 	multi-user mode (for research use only).          => Set up a non-graphical multi-user system.
5 runlevel5.target/graphical.target 	Graphical mode multiuser, with networking.        => Set up a graphical multi-user system.
6 runlevel6.target/reboot.target 	Reboot the system.                                => Shut down and reboot the system.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See the current and previous run levels of your machine by below command:
# runlevel

# systemctl list-units --type target

# who -r

# systemctl show -p WantedBy sshd.service
-------------------------------

Change Default Runlevel

The default runlevel can be set either by using the systemctl command or making a symbolic link of runlevel targets to the default.target file.

1. Using systemctl Command:
Let’s check the current run level by running the following command.
# systemctl get-default
Change the default run level.
# systemctl set-default multi-user.target

2. Making Symbolic link of runlevel targets:
Before making the symbolic link, let’s list out the runlevel files in the systemd directory.
# ls /lib/systemd/system/runlevel*target -l
Issue the following command to make a symbolic link of runlevel5.target to the default.target file.
# ln -sf /lib/systemd/system/runlevel5.target /etc/systemd/system/default.target
or
# ln -sf /lib/systemd/system/graphical.target /etc/systemd/system/default.target

Reboot the server and check it out.

Changing current runlevel
To change the runlevel for a system without rebooting or changing the /etc/inittab file, execute the following command as the root user:

# telinit [runlevel_value]
With [runlevel_value] having the following values:

# telinit 5

# systemctl isolate graphical.target

# runlevel

0 — Halt
1 — Single-user mode
2 — Not used (user-definable)
3 — Full multi-user mode
4 — Not used (user-definable)
5 — Full multi-user mode (with an X-based login screen)
6 — Reboot


=====================

You can temporarily switch into other immediately but it is for one time only, not permanent.
Just Mention the runlevel number after init command.
e.g. 0 to halt the machine and 6 to reboot.
# init 0
or 
#init 5
