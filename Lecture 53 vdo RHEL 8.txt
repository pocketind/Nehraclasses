Create a VDO Volume On a Storage Device on RHEL 8:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Introduced by RedHat in RHEL 7.5 and later, VDO short for Virtual Date Optimizer is a block virtualization technology that provides inline deduplication and compression of data at a block device level. The idea of deduplication is quite simple: to remove copies of duplicate data and only remain with one copy. When an identical file is added on a block device, it is marked as a duplicate and the original file is referenced instead. In so doing, VDO helps is saving the block volume’s space.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a VDO volume on a storage device on the RHEL 8 system.

Step 1: Install the VDO in RHEL 8
To get started, log in to your server and update your RHEL using the dnf command.
  dnf update -y
  dnf install kmod-kvdo vdo
  systemctl start vdo
  systemctl enable vdo
  systemctl status vdo
  lsblk
  vdo create --name=vdo1 --device=/dev/xvdb --vdoLogicalSize=300G
  reboot
  vdo create --name=vdo1 --device=/dev/xvdb --vdoLogicalSize=300G

create – This initiates the creation of the VDO volume.

–name=vdo1 – This gives the volume a label known as vdo1. Feel free to assign any name of your choice.

–device=/dev/xvdb – The device option specifies the disk on which the volume will be created.

–vdoLogicalSize=300G – This indicates the effective volume capacity to be used by the operating system, in this case, 300G.

 ls -l /dev/mapper/vdo1
 vdostats --hu
 vdostats --verbose /dev/mapper/vdo1 | grep -B6 ‘saving percent’
 pvcreate /dev/mapper/vdo1
 vgcreate vdo1vg /dev/mapper/vdo1
 vgdisplay vdo1vg
 lvcreate -n vdo1v01 -L 50G vdo1vg
 lvcreate -n vdo1v02 -L 50G vdo1vg  
 lvs
 mkfs.xfs  -K /dev/vdo1vg/vdo1v01
 mkfs.xfs  -K /dev/vdo1vg/vdo1v02
 mkdir /data/v01
 mkdir /data/v02
 mount -o discard /dev/vdo1vg/vdo1v01  /data/v01
 mount -o discard /dev/vdo1vg/vdo1v02  /data/v02
 vdostats --hu
 df -hT

In this tutorial, we demonstrated how you can create a VDO volume from an additional storage device on RHEL 8. We later went ahead and demonstrated how you can create more volumes and create filesystems from those volumes.
