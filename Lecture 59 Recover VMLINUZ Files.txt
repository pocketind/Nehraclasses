How to Recover GRUB 2 Bootloader in CentOS 8:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) 2 is part of GNU Project and the default bootloader for famous Linux distros like RHEL, CentOS, Ubuntu, etc. GRUB is the first software program that runs when a computer is started. GRUB is responsible for loading the Kernel software. The Kernel then initializes the rest of the operating system.

There are situations in which GRUB bootloader is corrupted. In such scenarios, the SysAdmin have to perform the recovery of the GRUB.

In this article, we are discussing the following four scenarios and how to recover GRUB 2 bootloader in CentOS 8 server.

The GRUB menu i.e. grub.cfg is corrupted or missing.
The CentOS 8 Kernel i.e. vmlinuz-4.x is corrupted or missing.
The CentOS 8 initrd i.e. initramfs-4.x is corrupted or missing.
The /boot directory is corrupted or missing.

Environment Specification:
We have provisioned virtual machine with minimally installed CentOS 8 operating system with following specification.

CPU - 3.4 Ghz (2 cores)
Memory - 1 GB
Storage - 20 GB
Operating System - CentOS 8.0
Hostname - grub-recovery-01.recipes.com
IP Address - 192.168.116.206 /24
 

How to Recover grub.cfg (GRUB Menu) in CentOS 8:
Connect with grub-recovery-01.recipes.com using ssh as root user.

To produce this recovery scenario, we are deleting the grub.cfg.


 
[root@grub-recovery-01 ~]# rm -f /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

 
Your system will continue to perform smoothly, unless you restart it and it will then unable to find the grub.cfg file and it will failed to boot CentOS 8 operating system.

Reboot the system now.

[root@grub-recovery-01 ~]# systemctl reboot
The machine will now boot into GRUB prompt because of the missing grub.cfg file.

      Minimal BASH-like line editing is supported. For the first word,
      TAB lists possible command completions. Anywhere else TAB lists
      possible device or file completions.

At the CentOS 8 installation menu, select Troubleshooting and press <ENTER>.

02-recover-grub-2-bootloader-centos-8-troubleshooting-menu

Select Rescue a CentOS Linux system and press <ENTER>.

03-recover-grub-2-bootloader-centos-8-rescue-prompt

It will ask you for mounting your filesystem, choose the option and '1' and press <ENTER>.

Press <ENTER> again to acquire a shell.

Execute chroot command to access your filesystem.

sh-4.4# chroot /mnt/sysimage
By using grub2-mkconfig command, you can regenerate grub.cfg file.

bash-4.4# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
If you are working on an UEFI based machine then you have to generate grub.cfg file in /boot/efi/EFI/centos/ directory.

If you are using SELinux, then create following file to trigger SELinux file relabeling process on next startup.

bash-4.4# touch /.autorelabel
Finally exit from chrooted environment and reboot your system.

bash-4.4# exit
sh-4.4# reboot
Boot using your Hard Disk and now it will display the GRUB boot menu this time.

How to Recover vmlinuz-4.x (Kernel) in CentOS 8:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Connect with grub-recovery-01.recipes.com using ssh as root user.

To produce this recovery scenario, we are removing the vmlinuz-4.18.0-80.el8.x86_64 file.

[root@grub-recovery-01 ~]# rm -f /boot/vmlinuz-4.18.0-80.el8.x86_64
Reboot the system.

[root@grub-recovery-01 ~]# systemctl reboot
On boot, GRUB will display the following warning and unable to load Kernel file.

error: ../../grub-core/fs/fshelp.c:258:file '/vmlinuz-4.18.0-80.el8.x86_64' not 
found.
