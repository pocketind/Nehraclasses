FIX INITRAMFS ERRORS:
++++++++++++++++++++++

1. See the details of Kernel Panic Error (Identify the reason behind it eg. New Kernel, Corrupted initramfs, New Packages after Patching, Hardware change etc.)

2. Login the system with root credentials through rescue mode.

3. Take necesarry action as the reason of getting this error.
If it is due to new kernel, then downgrade it.
If it is due to corrupted or missing initramfs, regenerate it.

4. In our case it is due to corrupted/absent initramfs file. First check your kernel version.
# uname -r

5. Now regenerate initramfs with dracut or mkinitrd command: (here your kernel version should be same as in previous command result)
To create new initramfs use:
# dracut initramfs-3.10.0-1062.el7.x86_64.img 3.10.0-1062.el7.x86_64
OR
# mkinitrd initramfs-3.10.0-1062.el7.x86_64.img 3.10.0-1062.el7.x86_64

To replace exsiting initramfs file use:
# dracut -f initramfs-3.10.0-1062.el7.x86_64.img 3.10.0-1062.el7.x86_64
OR
# mkinitrd --force initramfs-3.10.0-1062.el7.x86_64.img 3.10.0-1062.el7.x86_64

How to Recover Corrupted GRUB 2 Bootloader in RHEL 8:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
You may need to reinstall the GRUB 2 boot loader when the system does not boot into the GRUB menu.
This may be due to the installation of security patches or human error.

If the GRUB 2 boot loader corrupted on your system then you will end up with one of the following error messages.

In this guide, we will demonstrate how to repair corrupted GRUB 2 Bootloader in RHEL 8 system.

To demonstrate this, let’s remove the grub.cfg file from the system and restart it. If the ‘grub.cfg’ file is missing or corrupted the GRUB 2 boot loader will show the following error message.

# rm -rf /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

# systemctl reboot

After the reboot, you will see the following error message.

Error message of grub.cfg file corruption in RHEL 8

Make a note: Your system will continue to work as expected unless you restart it. If you restart, it will end up with the above error message because it did not find the ‘grub.cfg’ file.

Similarly, we will delete the ‘grub2’ directory completely from the system and restart it

# rm -rf /boot/grub2/

# systemctl reboot

You will see the following error message in the GRUB 2 menu.

How to Reinstall Corrupted GRUB 2 on RHEL 8
To reinstall or recover the 'grub.cfg' file or 'grub2' directory you need to boot your system with the installation DVD/ISO image. On boot screen of Red Hat 8, Select the ‘Troubleshooting’ option and press enter.

Troubleshooting option from Rescue Mode in RHEL 8
In the next screen, select the ‘Rescue a Red Hat Enterprise Linux system’ option and press enter.

Rescue option from the Installation DVD/ISO image in RHEL 8
On the next screen, select option ‘1 (Continue)’ and hit ‘ENTER’.

Mount the root file system under /mnt/sysimage directory in Rescue Mode
Chroot into the ‘/mnt/sysimage’ directory in order to use the actual root partition instead of Anaconda rescue mode environment root partition.

# chroot /mnt/sysimage
Recovering the corrupted GRUB 2 Bootloader
Install GRUB2 in the the primary hard disk, it would be ‘/dev/sda’. The ‘grub-install’ command installs GRUB onto a given device, which includes copying GRUB images into the target directory (generally /boot/grub2).

To check version of grub2-mkconfig command you can run the following command.
# grub2-mkconfig --version

Then install grub to the disk.
# grub2-install /dev/sda

Create a configuration file for GRUB2. The ‘grub2-mkconfig’ command creates a new configuration file ‘grub.cfg’ based on the current system configuration. This command uses the '/etc/default/grub' file, and the customizable scripts in the directory '/etc/grub.d/' when generating the ‘grub.cfg’ file.

# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

Enable the SELinux relabeling process on the next system boot:
 
# touch /.autorelabel

Exit the chroot environment and reboot the system by executing the exit command twice:

# exit

# exit

Make a note: The system will automatically perform the relabeling process of all files, and the system will automatically restart when the relabeling process is complete.

SELinux relabeling processes is on-going in RHEL 8
Now, you can able to boot your system with the newly installed bootloader without any issues.

Red Hat 8 GRUB 2 Menu
Installing GRUB2 on a UEFI system
On the UEFI based systems, you need to install or re-install appropriate packages:

Re-install the necessary packages.

# yum reinstall grub2-efi shim
If the above command ends with an error, install the packages.

# yum install grub2-efi shim
Create the ‘grub.cfg’ configuration file using the grub2-mkconfig command:

# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg
Wrapping Up

In this guide, we have described how to recover a corrupted GRUB 2 Bootloader in Red Hat (RHEL) 8 system using the Anaconda Rescue Mode from installation DVD/ISO. This same procedure works on other RHEL 8 clones such as CentOS 8, Rocky Linux 8 and AlmaLinux 8.
